Repo for all my self improvement tech I create

I've been super bored recently and have been wanting to make coding a more integral part of my daily routine so I'm creating this.
Basically gonna be a bunch of different projects one self improvement topics that I learn about from certain media.
The goal is to:
1. Consume more intential media that improves my life
2. Create more coding projects to have coding as a hobby 
3. Take actionable steps to improve my life
4. Create at least 1 tool that can improve at least 1 other persons life
I think if I do all of these this will be a success

Note on goal setting:
I think generally the easiest way to have ideas or be inspired on a project is to have a goal
Each project I create will have a specific goal from one of these large goals here:
1. Improve my financial status
2. Look better
3. Become fitter
4. Become better at CS & Coding
5. Become more focused
6. Become more calm

Media I'm currently consuming
1. Huberman Labs - https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab
2. Lex Fridman - https://www.youtube.com/c/lexfridman
3. Hamza - https://www.youtube.com/@Hamza97

As far as projects go there's gonna be two categories
1. Things I'm planning on definitely starting
  * These are 100% projects that will be worked on to an mvp at somepoint
2. Things I think are interesting
  * These are ideas bouncing around that I may or may not flesh out and get to
Idea list is down below, if you come across this feel free to open a pr for new ideas or fork it and create your own I'd love to see them

We're all gonna make it brahs
( also I need to figure out a way to have all the projects be attatched to this repo, easiest is orphan branches but that kinda sucks so idk)
